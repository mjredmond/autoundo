Simple python undo/redo framework for gui's.  Python 3 support only.
I think this is a pretty good idea for undo/redo for gui's.  It would be much better to inspect the ast tree, determine what could possibly be modified in the functions/methods, and go from there.  Someone smarter than me could do that and this could be an awesome library.
